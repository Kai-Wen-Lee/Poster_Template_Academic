  abstract  = {This book provides readers with the skills they need to write
computer codes that simulate convection, internal gravity waves,
and magnetic field generation in the interiors and atmospheres of
rotating planets and stars. Using a teaching method perfected in
the classroom, Gary Glatzmaier begins by offering a step-by-step
guide on how to design codes for simulating nonlinear
time-dependent thermal convection in a two-dimensional box using
Fourier expansions in the horizontal direction and finite
differences in the vertical direction. He then describes how to
implement more efficient and accurate numerical methods and more
realistic geometries in two and three dimensions. In the third part
of the book, Glatzmaier demonstrates how to incorporate more
sophisticated physics, including the effects of magnetic field,
density stratification, and rotation.Featuring numerous exercises throughout, this is an ideal
textbook for students and an essential resource for
researchers.
Describes how to create codes that simulate the internal
dynamics of planets and stars

Builds on basic concepts and simple methods

Shows how to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the
numerical methods

Describes more relevant geometries and boundary conditions
