\1 Breaking of symmetry is shown in both the mean temperature profile and the r.m.s. velocity profiles, as is expected in NOB RBC.
\1 Lower centre temperature ($T_c$) and mean temperature is seen in the rapidly rotating ($Ro_m = 0.2$) case compared to the slowly rotating cases.
\1 Further simulations will be run, covering control parameters: $Ra_m = 10^6, \: 10^7, \: 10^8$ ; $Ro_m = 0.2, \: 1.0, \: 3.0$.
